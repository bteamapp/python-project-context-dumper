# Free Python Project Context Dumper

A tiny Python tool that recursively scans a project folder and creates a single Markdown file (`project_context.md`) containing all **text-based files** â€” skipping images, videos, audio files, and itself.

Perfect for passing full project context into an AI (LLM) for summarization, agent memory, or fine-tuning tasks.
